General notebook with workspaces, calendar, tasks, contacts and many other things

## Important!
All this code may not contain tests, it written all by myself, this code made only for one purpose - MAKE NOTEBOOK 
SUITABLE FOR ONLY MY NEEDS ( notebooks, workspaces, calendar, reminders, bookshelf, save links, fast, simple and free ).

### Why?
Because I can't find any note taking app without some things I find useful. Notion - to complex and basically kill
browser, mobile client to slow, I think it's too over engineered. Evernote - enterprise, slow, no native Linux client, 
no build in calendar. CherryTree - no calendar, no file storage, no remote database, no reminders, no mobile client and 
ONLY local storage on your pc, it's cool but I need more functions.
